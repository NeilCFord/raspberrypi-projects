##Minecraft Pi Projects##

*Updated 20160124 - changed most files to work with the version of the Minecraft API that now comes preinstalled on Raspbian Jessie and Python3*

A lot of the code featured here is based off the work of Martin O'Hanlon at [Stuff About Code](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/). Please visit his site and his [Github repository](https://github.com/martinohanlon) for many more awesome examples.

Newer examples are based on Craig Richardson's book, "Learn to Program with Minecraft" available from [No Starch Press](https://www.nostarch.com/programwithminecraft)

**clear.py** - clear a space 25 blocks in all directions from the player's position, replacing the floor with stone.

**magipi.py** - A simple demo of console messages and moving the player. As featured in [The MagPi magazine](http://www.themagpi.com/issue/issue-11/) Issue 11.

**sphere.py** - Draws a radius 6 gold sphere in the air. Borrowed from Martin O'Hanlon I believe.

**diamondsphere.py** - As above, but in diamond.

**drawbuilding.py** - Draws a building 5 floors high with windows. Not sure where I got this from.

**minecraft-bombs** - Martin O'Hanlon's exploding blocks code. [Original repository](https://github.com/martinohanlon/minecraft-bombs)

**minecraft-cannon** - Martin O'Hanlon's cannon. Blow stuff up! [Original repository](https://github.com/martinohanlon/minecraft-cannon)

**shelter.py** - builds a simple block shelter.

**pool.py** - makes a swimming pool under the player's feet and then tells you you are underwater!
